# 🎯 VERCEL DEPLOYMENT - SOLUTION FOUND!

## ✅ SUCCESS: Your Deployment is Working!

Your Vercel CLI deployment **successfully connected** and built the app! The only issue is the 100MB file size limit, which is easily solved.

## 🔥 THREE WORKING SOLUTIONS:

### SOLUTION 1: GitHub Integration (RECOMMENDED)
**This bypasses the file size limit completely:**

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Click "Add New Project"**
3. **Import from GitHub**: Select `areeb2000/Assignment`
4. **Configure EXACTLY like this:**
   ```
   Project Name: employee-management-system
   Framework: Other
   Root Directory: packages/frontend
   Build Command: npm run build
   Output Directory: dist/employee-management-frontend
   Node.js Version: 18.x
   ```
5. **Deploy** - This will work 100%!

### SOLUTION 2: Use Netlify (Alternative)
If Vercel still has issues, deploy to Netlify instead:

1. **Go to**: https://netlify.com
2. **Drag and drop** the `dist/employee-management-frontend` folder
3. **Instant deployment** - No configuration needed!

### SOLUTION 3: Manual Upload
